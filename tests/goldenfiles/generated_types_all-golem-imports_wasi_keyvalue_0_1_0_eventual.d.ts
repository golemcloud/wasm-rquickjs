/**
 * A keyvalue interface that provides eventually consistent CRUD operations.
 * A CRUD operation is an operation that acts on a single key-value pair.
 * The value in the key-value pair is defined as a `u8` byte array and the intention
 * is that it is the common denominator for all data types defined by different
 * key-value stores to handle data, ensuring compatibility between different
 * key-value stores. Note: the clients will be expecting serialization/deserialization overhead
 * to be handled by the key-value store. The value could be a serialized object from
 * JSON, HTML or vendor-specific data types like AWS S3 objects.
 * Data consistency in a key value store refers to the gaurantee that once a
 * write operation completes, all subsequent read operations will return the
 * value that was written.
 * The level of consistency in readwrite interfaces is **eventual consistency**,
 * which means that if a write operation completes successfully, all subsequent
 * read operations will eventually return the value that was written. In other words,
 * if we pause the updates to the system, the system eventually will return
 * the last updated value for read.
